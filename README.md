# Stormboard Chrome Extension

Add ideas to your Storms from your browser menu.

## Installation

Create a file called `config.js` in the same directory as `pop-up.js` with the following line:

```
const apiKey = '1234abcd';
```

Replace 1234abcd with your Stormboard API Key (so that your API Key is surrounded by single quotes).

## Usage

If your Storm list does not load, navigate to [https://api.stormboard.com/docs](https://api.stormboard.com/docs) and click the extension's icon in your browser menu once or twice to reload the extension.
