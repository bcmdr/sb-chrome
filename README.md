# Stormboard Chrome Extension

Add ideas to your Storms from your browser menu.

## Installation

Create a file called `config.js` in the same directory as `pop-up.js` with the following line:

```
const apiKey = '1234abcd';
```

Replace 1234abcd with your Stormboard API Key (so that your API Key is surrounded by single quotes).

## Usage

If your Storm list does not load, navigate to [api.stormboard.com/docs](https://api.stormboard.com/docs) and click the extension's icon in your browser menu once or twice to reload the extension.

### Creating a Sticky Note

1. Click and type in the yellow text area.
2. Select the target Storm from the drop-down below the yellow text area.
3. Click `Save Idea`.
4. Optionally, click `Go to Storm` to navigate to the Storm selected in the drop-down above.
